#### HOW TO MASTER SECRET WORK.html

Everyone, from top to bottom, must have good cover stories to protect them. This is a legend or story which hides or camouflages the real work being done. For example: a secret meeting in a park is made to look like a chance meeting between friends. If they are ever questioned they give the legend that they simply bumped into each other and had a discussion about football.

All members of the network are given code names. These conceal their real identities. They must have good identification documents. Especially those living an illegal life. A lot of time and effort must be given to creating good legends to protect our people. There is nothing that arouses suspicion as much as a stranger who has no good reason for being around.

Secret forms of communicating between our people must be studied and used.

They do not prepare properly; rush about attracting attention; fail to keep time; do not cover the activity with a legend (cover story); talk loosely etc. 

Behave naturally and do not draw attention to yourself! `Be like the people'. Merge with them!

No loose talk! Guard secrets with your life! Follow the saying: `Don't trust anyone and talk as little as possible'.

Make all preparations beforehand! Avoid a regular pattern of behaviour which makes it easy for the enemy to check on you.

Remove all traces of illegal work that can lead to you! Wipe fingerprints off objects. Know that typewriters, PRINTERS can be traced; goods bought from shops can be checked.

Hide materials such as leaflets, weapons etc! But not where you live. Memorise sensitive names, addresses etc. Don't write them down!

Know your town, its streets, parks, shops etc. like the palm of your hand! This will help you find secret places and enable you to check whether you are being followed.

It is important not to draw attention to oneself by strange behaviour such as constantly looking over one's shoulder. And one must guard against paranoia, that is, imagining that everyone you see is following you.

Telephone: This allows for the urgent transmission of a signal or message. The telephone must be used with a reliable and convincing coding system and legend. Under no circumstances must the phone be used for involved discussion on sensitive topics.

Weak knowledge of the operational situation:

This means not paying sufficient attention to the conditions in the area where you carry out your tasks. Comrades are often caught because they failed to study the methods used by the enemy, the time of police patrols, guard system, use of informers etc. Mistakes are made if you fail to take into account the behaviour of local people, cultural mannerisms and habits, forms of dress etc. Knowledge of political, economic, geographic and transport conditions are part of the operational picture.

### Situational Awareness: Steganography: A Lesser Known Method of Concealing Electronic Information, Attacking Systems
#### JOINT REGIONAL INTELLIGENCE CENTER
#### LAJRIC-Steganography.pdf

Some indicators of steganography may include:

Possession of steganography software, or visiting sites known to contain steganography.
Sharing of content that is inconsistent with a subject’s life, such as pictures of children when he or she is not known to have any.
Possession of books or articles on — or, expression of interest in cryptography or steganography

### Operations Security (OPSEC) Plan
#### operations-security-plan.odt

The principles of OPSEC are easy to remember:

 * What information do you want to protect? 
 * Who wants your information? 
 * How is your information vulnerable? 
 * What is the risk for your information? 
 * How can you protect your information? 

The OPSEC process involves five steps:
(1) identification of critical information, (2) analysis of threats, (3) analysis of vulnerabilities, (4) assessment of risk, and (5) application of appropriate countermeasures.

### OPSEC in the Age of Egotistical Giraffe
#### D1T1 - The Grugq - OPSEC in the Age of Egotistical Giraffe.pdf

Attackers have bosses and budgets too (finite resources).
If it's stupid but it works, it's not stupid. Murphy's laws of war 
Enterprise security: Compartment and secure something smaller
OPSEC WORKS: Counterintelligence hasn’t changed in thousands of years
OPSEC: THREE C’S
 * Cover
   - (Action) Normal to do what you are doing.
   - (Status) Normal to be where you are
 * Concealment
   - Hide the activity	
   - Prevent anyone from knowing about it	
   - Hide identities
 * Compartmentation
   - Limit the number of people involved
   - Limit scope of the damage if it goes wrong
   - The last line of defence

OPSEC Maxim:

"Distance in space and time increases adversarial costs"
"When your adversary discovers there’s a secret, the first battle is lost."
"Never write if you can speak, never speak if you can nod, never nod if you can wink."
"I must not trust. Trust is the OPSEC killer. Trust is the fatal error that brings total obliteration."
"People make mistakes."

USING ENCRYPTION STANDS OUT!

### Introduction to Operations Security (Air force briefing)
#### opsec overview.odp

OPSEC is a risk management instrument that enables a manager or commander to view an operation or activity from the perspective of an adversary. It is a process of identifying, analyzing and controlling critical information.

Critical Information Commandments:
1. Thou must protect the information that the adversary needs to accomplish his mission.
2. Thou shall not try to protect everything.
3. Consider who thy adversaries are and what information they require to inflict harm to you.
4. Thou shall consult all sources of information to determine what thine enemies know about you.
5. Once thou has determined what information is critical, thou shall determine if that information is associated with thine activities.

### Always assume the worst
#### http://dcid.me/notes/2013-jun-20

 * Always assume that you are being monitored. Specially online. It could be your government, a foreign country, your ISP, or even from within your network. Someone might be watching you.
 * Always assume that your network is compromised. Because it might really be and you don’t know yet.
 * Always assume that all your emails are being read.
 * Always assume that all your IM (instant messages) are being read.
 * Always assume that any “private” content you put online is going to be public someday.
 * Always assume that your data will be lost.
 * Always assume that some servers or computers that you own are already compromised.
 * Always assume that some of your employees (or co-workers) can’t be trusted. And you really don’t know which ones are.
 * Always assume that there is someone, right now, trying to hack you. This one is really true.
 * Always assume that there is someone, right now, that is smarter than you, trying to hack you.
