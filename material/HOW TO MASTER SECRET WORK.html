<p align="left"><i>First published during the 'eighties as a series of articles
in 'Umsebenzi'; later as a single pamphlet for underground operatives.</i></p>
<p><strong>1. INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>This is a pamphlet about the role of secrecy in solving the tasks of the
Revolution. Secrecy gives us protection by starving the enemy of information
about us. Secrecy helps us build a strong revolutionary movement to overthrow
the enemy.</p>
<p>There is nothing sinister about using secret methods to help win freedom.
Through the ages the ruling classes have made it as difficult as possible for
the oppressed people to gain freedom. The oppressors use the most cruel and
sinister methods to stay in power. They use unjust laws to ban, banish, imprison
and execute their opponents. They use secret police, soldiers, spies and
informers against the people's movements. But the people know how to fight back
and how to use secret methods of work.</p>
<p>The early history of struggle in our country is full of good examples.
Makanda, Cetshwayo, Sekhukhune and Bambatha made use of secret methods to
organise resistance. Bambatha, for example, prepared his rebellion against
colonialism in great secrecy from the Nkandla forest.</p>
<p><strong>Secrecy has Helped us Outwit the Enemy:</strong></p>
<p>The enemy tries to give the impression that it is impossible to carry out
illegal work. The rulers boast about all our people they have killed or
captured. They point to the freedom fighters locked up in the prisons. But a lot
of that talk is sheer bluff. Of course it is impossible to wage a struggle
without losses. The very fact, however, that the South African Communist Party
and African National Congress have survived years of illegality is proof that
the regime cannot stop our noble work. It is because we have been mastering
secret work that we have been able, more and more, to outwit the enemy.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline, Vigilance and Self-Control:</strong></p>
<p>Secret methods are based on common sense and experience. But they must be
mastered like an art. Discipline, vigilance and self-control are required. A
resistance organiser in Nazi-occupied France who was never captured said this
was because he `never used the telephone and never went to public places like
bars, restaurants and post offices'. He was living a totally underground life.
But even those members of a secret movement who have a legal existence must
display the qualities we have referred to.</p>
<p><strong>Study and Apply the Rules of Secrecy:</strong></p>
<p>Most people know from films and books that secret work involves the use of
codes, passwords, safe houses and hiding places. Activists must study the rules
of secrecy and apply them seriously. This enables us to build up secret
organisations linked to the people. This secret network becomes a vital force in
helping to lead the people in the struggle for power. In our series we will
discuss such topics as:</p>
<ol>
  <li>How to set up a secret network;</li>
  <li>The rules of secrecy;</li>
  <li>How to overcome surveillance (i.e. observation);</li>
  <li>Secret forms of communication;</li>
  <li>Technical Methods such as secret writing, hiding places etc.;</li>
  <li>How to behave under interrogation (i.e. when being questioned by the
    enemy).</li>
</ol>
<p>These are among the main elements of secret work.</p>
<p>To organise in secret is not easy, but remember: The most difficult work is
the most noble!</p>
<p><strong>2.SETTING UP A SECRET NETWORK</strong></p>
<p>We have said that secret work helps us overcome the problems created by the
enemy. This helps in the vital task of building an underground organisation or
secret network. The network must lead the people in the struggle for power. It
does not compete with the progressive legal organisations but reinforces them.
Let us look at some of the main measures involved:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Only serious and reliable people can be included in the secret network.
    The leaders must study the potential recruits very carefully. They are
    looking for people who are politically clean, determined, disciplined,
    honest and sober. People who can keep a secret. People who are brave and
    capable of defying the enemy even if captured.</li>
  <li>Recruits are organised into a unit or cell of three or four people. The
    number is limited in case of failure or arrest. The cell leader is the most
    experienced person. The cell members must not know the other members of the
    network.</li>
  <li>Only the cell leader knows and is in contact with a more senior member of
    the network. This senior contact gives instructions from the leadership and
    receives reports.</li>
  <li>A small committee of the most experienced people leads the network. This
    is a leadership cell of two or three persons. This cell might be in charge
    of a factory, location, township or city. A city network takes the form of a
    pyramid. The city underground committee is at the top. Local cells are at
    the base. Middle command cells are in between. Start with one cell. Gain
    experience before building more. (diagram 1)</li>
  <li>A rule of secret work is that members must know only that which is
    necessary to fulfil their tasks. Everyone, from top to bottom, must have
    good cover stories to protect them. This is a legend or story which hides or
    camouflages the real work being done. For example: a secret meeting in a
    park is made to look like a chance meeting between friends. If they are ever
    questioned they give the legend that they simply bumped into each other and
    had a discussion about football.</li>
  <li>All members of the network are given code names. These conceal their real
    identities. They must have good identification documents. Especially those
    living an illegal life. A lot of time and effort must be given to creating
    good legends to protect our people. There is nothing that arouses suspicion
    as much as a stranger who has no good reason for being around.</li>
  <li>All illegal documents, literature, reports and weapons (when not in use)
    must be carefully hidden. Special hiding places must be built. Codes must be
    used in reports to conceal sensitive names and information.</li>
  <li>The leaders must see that all members are trained in the rules and methods
    of secret work . It is only through this training that they will develop the
    skills to outwit the enemy.</li>
  <li>Technical methods such as the use of invisible writing, codes and disguise
    must be mastered. Counter-surveillance methods which help check whether one
    is being watched by the enemy must be known. Secret forms of communicating
    between our people must be studied and used. This is all part of the
    training. These methods will be dealt with later.</li>
  <li>Specialisation: Once the network has been developed some cells should
    specialise in different tasks such as propaganda, sabotage, combat work,
    mass work, factory organisation etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the meantime you can start putting into practice some of the points
already dealt with. Begin to work out legends in your work. What innocent reason
can you give if a friend or a policeman finds this journal in your possession?</p>
<p><strong></strong><strong>3. SOME RULES OF SECRECY.</strong></p>
<p>Carelessness leads to arrests. Loose talk and strange behaviour attracts the
attention of police and <i>izimpimpi</i>. Secret work needs vigilance and care.
Rules of secrecy help to mask our actions and overcome difficulties created by
the enemy. But first let us study the following situation:</p>
<p><strong>What Not To Do</strong></p>
<p>X, a trade unionist, also leads a secret cell. He phones Y and Z, his cell
members, and arranges to meet outside a cinema. X leaves his office and rushes
to the meeting 30 minutes late. Y and Z have been anxiously checking the time
and pacing up and down. The three decide to go to a nearby tea-room where they
have often met before. They talk over tea in low tones. People from the cinema
start coming in. One is a relative of X who greets him. Y and Z are nervous and
abruptly leave. When X is asked who they were he hesitates and, wanting to
impress his relatives, replies: `They're good guys who like to hear from me
what's going on'. This opens the way for a long discussion on politics. X has
made many errors which would soon put the police on the trail of all three.
These seem obvious but in practice many people behave just like X. They do not
prepare properly; rush about attracting attention; fail to keep time; do not
cover the activity with a legend (cover story); talk loosely etc. Others pick up
the bad style of work. X should set a good example for Y and Z. To avoid such
mistakes rules of secrecy must be studied and practised. They might seem obvious
but should never be taken for granted.</p>
<p><strong></strong><strong>Things to Remember</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Always have a believable' legend to cover your work! (X could have said Y
    and Z were workers he vaguely knew whom he had met by chance and had been
    encouraging to join the union).</li>
  <li>Underground membership must be secret! (X had no need to refer to Y and Z
    as `good guys').</li>
  <li>Behave naturally and do not draw attention to yourself! `Be like the
    people'. Merge with them! (X, Y and Z behaved suspiciously.)</li>
  <li>No loose talk! Guard secrets with your life! Follow the saying: `Don't
    trust anyone and talk as little as possible'. (X fails here).</li>
  <li>Be vigilant against informers! They try to get close to you, using
    militant talk to `test' and trap you. (Can X be so sure of his relative?)</li>
  <li>Be disciplined, efficient, punctual (X was none of these). Only wait ten
    minutes at a meeting place. The late comer may have been arrested.</li>
  <li>Make all preparations beforehand! Avoid a regular pattern of behaviour
    which makes it easy for the enemy to check on you. (X made poor arrangements
    for the meeting; rushed there from a sensitive place and could have been
    followed; used the tea-room too often).</li>
  <li>Do not try to discover what does not concern you! Know only what you have
    to know for carrying out your tasks.</li>
  <li>Be careful what you say on the phone (which may be `bugged'), or in a
    public place (where you can be overheard)! Conceal sensitive information
    such as names etc. by using simple codes!</li>
  <li>Remove all traces of illegal work that can lead to you! Wipe fingerprints
    off objects. Know that typewriters can be traced; goods bought from shops
    can be checked.</li>
  <li>Hide materials such as leaflets, weapons etc! But not where you live.
    Memorise sensitive names, addresses etc. Don't write them down!</li>
  <li>Carry reliable documents of identification!</li>
  <li>Know your town, its streets, parks, shops etc. like the palm of your hand!
    This will help you find secret places and enable you to check whether you
    are being followed.</li>
  <li>If you are arrested you must deny all secret work and never reveal the
    names of your comrades even to the point of death!</li>
  <li>Finally, if any member of your underground cell is arrested, you must
    immediately act on the assumption that they will be forced to give
    information. This means taking precautions, such as going into hiding if
    necessary. When the rules of secrecy are practised revolutionaries make good
    progress. Practice makes perfect and with discipline and vigilance we will
    outwit the enemy and we will win!</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>4. SURVEILLANCE</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. What is Surveillance?</strong></p>
<p>In their efforts to uncover secret revolutionary activity the police put a
close watch on suspected persons and places. This organised form of observation
is called surveillance. There are two general types of surveillance: mobile and
stationary. Mobile is sometimes refer red to as `tailing' or `shadowing' and
involves following the suspect (subject) around. Stationary is observing the
subject, his or her home and workplace, from a fixed position. This can be from
a parked car, neighbouring building or shop and is referred to as a `stake-out'
in detective films. Surveillance combines both `tailing' and `stake-outs'.</p>
<p><strong></strong><strong>2. Counter-Surveillance</strong></p>
<p>Members of a secret network must use methods of counter-surveillance to
protect themselves and their underground organisation. You can establish whether
you are being watched or followed. These methods can be effectively used and
help you to give the police the impression that you are not involved in secret
work. Before considering these methods of protection, however, we need to be
more aware of the enemy's surveillance methods. For it is not possible to deal
with surveillance unless we know how it operates.</p>
<p><strong>3. Aim of Surveillance</strong></p>
<p>The primary aim of surveillance is to gather information about the subject
and to check out whether he or she is involved in secret work. The police seek
to establish the links between the subject and those he or she might be working
with. The enemy wants to identify you and locate the residences and secret
places you use. They try to collect evidence to prove that illegal work has been
committed. An important use of surveillance is to check on information received
from informers.</p>
<p><strong>4. Decision for Surveillance</strong></p>
<p>A decision to place a subject under surveillance is taken at a high level.
The decision will include the intensity and duration for example whether for 8,
16 or 24 hours per day over a period of one, two, three or more weeks. The
decision will involve placing the subject's house and workplace under
observation and having his or her phone tapped either temporarily or
permanently. The number of persons involved in the operation will be decided
upon and they will be given the known facts about the subject including a
description or photograph. Whether the surveillance ends with the arrest of the
subject will depend on what is learnt during the investigation.</p>
<p><strong>5. The Surveillance Team</strong></p>
<p>Specially trained plainclothes men and women are used to carry out
surveillance. Their identities are kept strictly secret. They are not the
normally known or public special branch policemen. They are aged between 25 and
50 years and have to be physically fit for work. In appearance and dress they
are average types. They try to blend in with their surroundings and avoid
drawing attention to themselves. For example, smartly dressed whites will not be
used to follow a black person in a poor, run-down area.</p>
<p>A team may consist of 2-4 people with a car in support. Usually one team is
used at a time but more will be deployed if required. The subject will be
followed by foot, car or public transport if necessary. The surveillants
communicate with each other by discreet hand signals and small radio
transmitters. They make minor changes in their clothing and appearance to help
prevent recognition. For the same reason they try to avoid abrupt and unnatural
movements when following the subject.</p>
<p>In a crowded city street they will `stick' close to the subject (within 20
metres) for fear of losing him or her. In a quiet residential area they will
`hang' back (over 50 metres) for fear of exposing themselves. They have set
plans and procedures for `tailing' the subject which involves the constant
interchanging of positions. It is important to know these various techniques of
foot and vehicle surveillance.</p>
<p><strong></strong><strong>5. SURVEILLANCE TECHNIQUES</strong></p>
<p>We have defined surveillance as an organised form of observation in which the
police put a close watch on suspected persons or places. Various types of
surveillance and techniques of `tailing' the suspect (subject) are used. A
subject's home or place of work might be under observation from a stationary or
`fixed' position such as a neighbouring residence or vehicle. All comings and
goings are recorded. When the subject leaves his or her home they may be
followed by foot or car or combination of both. All the places they visit and
people they meet are noted, photographed and followed too if necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Foot Surveillance</strong></p>
<p>At least two people will be used to follow the subject whom we will call `S'.
They will communicate through hand-signals and `walkie-talkie' radios so as to
guide and assist each other. They will keep as close to S as 15 metres in
crowded areas and hang well back, up to 100 metres, in quiet streets. They will
try to be as inconspicuous as possible so as not to arouse S's suspicions. They
will have a car to assist them, which keeps out of sight in the adjacent
streets.</p>
<p><strong>Two-Man or `AB' Surveillance</strong></p>
<p>The person following directly behind S is A. The second person is B, who
follows on behind A, as if in a chain. A and B alternate positions, `leap-frogging'
over each other (Figure 1). When S turns right at a corner A drops back out of
sight and B takes the lead position. An alternative technique is for A to cross
the road and then turn right. In this case A is not now following directly
behind B as in a chain, but is parallel to B on the opposite side of the road to
both B and S and slightly to their rear (Figure 2). A and B will avoid direct
contact with S. If S now crosses the street to the left A will either fall back,
enter a shop or walk swiftly ahead, while B will follow S from his side of the
street (Figure 3).</p>
<p><strong>Three Man or `ABC' Surveillance</strong></p>
<p>Inclusion of the extra man makes tailing S easier. A follows S, B follows A
and C operates across the street from S to the rear. When S turns a corner, A
may continue in the original direction, crossing the street instead of
immediately turning. A thus takes the C position, whilst either B or C can take
A's original position (Figure 4).</p>
<p>A variety of techniques can obviously be used. But the idea is generally the
same. Those following must keep the subject under constant observation without
arousing suspicion. The more persons used, the greater the scope and flexibility
of the operation.</p>
<p>Remember: By knowing the methods of the enemy we can deal with him and defeat
him!</p>
<p>(Diagram 2)</p>
<p>We have dealt above with following people on foot. We now turn to `tailing'
by vehicle.</p>
<p><strong>Vehicle Surveillance</strong></p>
<p>A variety of vehicles may be used in surveillance car, van, truck or
motorbike. These must be dependable and powerful but not flashy so as to avoid
attracting attention. A surveillance vehicle will carry no visible police
identification but of necessity will be equipped with a two-way radio (so look
out for the antenna!)</p>
<p>In heavy traffic the tailing vehicle will stick close behind the suspect's
vehicle, hereafter referred to as the subject or `S'. In light traffic it will
hang well back, but it will always try to keep two or three cars behind S
(Figure 1), especially in One-Vehicle Surveillance. The tailing-vehicle will
remain in the same lane as S to avoid making sudden turns from the wrong lane.
There are normally two persons in a tailing vehicle. The passenger is always
ready to alight and carry out foot surveillance if S parks his or her car or
gets out of it. As in foot surveillance, inconspicuous actions are required so
as not to arouse the suspicions of S. When more tailing vehicles are used, the
scope and flexibility of the operation is increased. But normally two tailing
vehicles are utilised. The number depends on the degree of urgency of the
operation.</p>
<p>(Diagram 3)</p>
<p><strong>Two and Three Vehicle Surveillance</strong></p>
<p>When two tailing vehicles are used, the lead tail A will remain two or three
cars behind S and B will remain behind A, as in a chain. They will always keep
switching places (Figure 2). When using a parallel tailing technique, A remains
behind S and B keeps pace in a parallel street. A and B keep switching positions
(Figure 3). With three tailing vehicles the possibilities are increased. A and B
follow S in a chain and a third vehicle C travels in a parallel street. C may
even speed ahead of S, awaiting it at an intersection before falling in behind
and taking A's position. This allows A to turn off and follow in a parallel
street (Figure 4).</p>
<p><strong>Reflectors and Bleepers</strong></p>
<p>Those carrying out surveillance may try to place a strip of reflectorised
tape on the rear of the subject's vehicle or break a tail-light to make it
easier to spot it at night. Or they may place an electronic tailing device on
S's car, called a Bumper Bleeper. This is a small metal box which can be fixed
to the vehicle with magnets in seconds. A radio signal is transmitted which the
tailing vehicle picks up on a receiver. S's car can be tracked even when out of
view! Such gadgets do not, however, make it impossible to avoid being tailed. It
only means that you must be alert and check for such devices. Knowing it is
there can help you to really mislead the enemy!</p>
<p><strong>Progressive Surveillance</strong></p>
<p>This technique is used when extreme caution is needed because the subject is
likely to use all methods to uncover possible surveillance. S is only followed
for a limited distance each day by foot or car. Observation is picked up again
at the time and place where it was previously discontinued. This continues day
after day until surveillance is completed or discontinued. Remember! Know the
enemy's methods to deal with him and defeat him!</p>
<p><strong></strong><strong>6.COUNTER-SURVEILLANCE</strong></p>
<p>We have been examining the enemy's surveillance methods, that is, the forms
of observation used to watch suspects and uncover secret revolutionary activity.
We now turn to counter-surveillance, which is the methods we use to deal with
enemy observation.</p>
<p><strong>Qualities Needed</strong></p>
<p>For successful counter-surveillance you need to be aware of your surroundings
and be alert to what is going on round you. That means having a thorough
knowledge of the town or area in which you live and work and knowing the habits
of the people. You need basic common sense, alertness and patience together with
cool and natural behaviour and a knowledge of certain tactics or ruses (which
will be discussed later). It is important not to draw attention to oneself by
strange behaviour such as constantly looking over one's shoulder. And one must
guard against paranoia, that is, imagining that everyone you see is following
you. It is necessary to develop powers of observation and memory (which come
with practice) so that you notice what is usual and remember what you have seen.
It is when you notice the same person or unusual behaviour a third or fourth
time that you are able to conclude that it adds up to surveillance and not
coincidence.</p>
<p><strong>Are You Being Watched?</strong></p>
<p>Study the normal situation where you live, work and socialise so as to
immediately recognise anything out of the ordinary. Are strangers loitering
about the streets? Are strange cars parked where the occupants have a commanding
view of your home? They may be a distance away spying on you through binoculars.
Do the vehicles have antennae for two-way radio communication? Do you notice
such strangers or vehicles on several occasions and in other parts of the town?
This would serve to confirm interest in you.</p>
<p>Have strangers moved into neighbouring houses or flats? Do you notice unusual
comings and goings or suspicious movements at upstairs windows? Try discreetly
to check who such people are. The enemy might have created an observation post
in the house opposite the road or placed an agent in the room next door to you!
Be sensitive to any change in attitude to you by neighbours, landlady,shopkeeper
etc. The enemy might have mobilised them for surveillance. Know such people
well, including the local children, and be on good terms with all. Then if
strangers question them about you, they will be more inclined to inform you.</p>
<p>Know the back routes and concealed entrances into your area so that you may
slip in and out unnoticed. Secretly check what is going on in the vicinity after
pretending to retire for the night. Avoid peering from behind curtains,
especially at night from a lit room. This is as suspicious as constantly
glancing over one's shoulder and will only alert the enemy to conceal themselves
better.</p>
<p>Record all unusual incidents in a note book so you can analyse events and
come to a conclusion. Be alert with persons you mix with at work or socially,
and those like receptionists, supervisors, waiters and attendants who are
well-placed to notice one's movements.</p>
<p><strong>Telephone and Mail</strong></p>
<p>Phone tapping often causes faults. Check with neighbours whether they are
having similar problems or is your phone the exception. Is your post being
interfered with? Check dates of posting, stamp cancellation and delivery and
compare the time taken for delivery with your friends. Examine the envelopes to
check whether they have been opened and glued down in a clumsy way. Some of
these checks do not necessarily confirm that you are being watched but they
alert you to the possibility. To confirm whether you are in fact under
observation requires techniques of checking which we will examine next.</p>
<p><strong>7.THE CHECK ROUTE</strong></p>
<p>The Check Route is a planned journey, preferably on foot, along which a
person carries out a number of discreet checks in order to determine whether
they are under surveillance. These checks take place at predetermined check
points which must give you the opportunity of checking for possible surveillance
without arousing the suspicion of those tailing you.</p>
<p>The check route should cover a distance of 3-4km, include such activities as
shopping, making innocent enquiries, catching a bus, enjoying refreshments etc,
and should last about one hour. The route should include quiet and busy areas
bearing in mind that it is easier that you have a valid reason for your
movements. If your actions are strange and inexplicable you will arouse the
suspicions of those following you.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a typical check route. Shortage of space obliges us to
confine the check points into a smaller area just a few city blocks than would
actually be the case. Check points are numbered 1 to 12.</p>
<p>(Diagram 4)</p>
<ol>
  <li>X walks down the street and pauses at a cinema to examine the posters
    -this gives a good chance to look back down the street and to notice those
    passing by (without looking over his shoulder),</li>
  <li>X crosses the road looking right and left and pops into a large store; he
    positions himself near the entrance whilst appearing to examine goods on
    display; he notices anyone entering after him; wanders around the store
    using lift, stairways etc. in order to spot anyone paying special interest
    in him; departs at side exit</li>
  <li>and crosses street into little-used alleyway or arcade; here he slightly
    picks up speed and crosses street, where</li>
  <li>shop with large plate glass windows gives good reflection of alley out of
    which he has emerged; X notices whether anyone is coming out of that alley
    to catch up with him ...</li>
  <li>X now proceeds down the street into bookshop with commanding view of the
    street he has come down; he browses around noticing anyone entering after
    him; he also observes whether anyone examines the books he has been browsing
    through (for a tail would want to check whether X has left a secret
    communication behind him for a contact); X makes a small purchase and
    exits...</li>
  <li>enters park and walks along winding paths which give good view of rear; X
    throws away an empty cigarette pack and retires to ...</li>
  <li>an out-door restaurant where he takes his tea; he observes whether anyone
    picks up the cigarette pack which a tail would want to check as in 5; and
    notices the customers arriving after him; any tail would want to check
    whether X is meeting someone; as X leaves he notices whether any of the
    customers are eager to leave immediately after him ...</li>
  <li>X crosses the street into a Post Office; once inside he is able to observe
    whether anyone is crossing the street from the park after him; he buys some
    stamps and notices anyone queuing behind him (a tail will be especially
    interested in transactions taking place in post offices, banks etc.); X may
    also make a `phone call at a public box and check whether anyone attempts to
    overhear his conversation;</li>
  <li>on departing X stops a stranger in the street to ask him the way; this
    allows him to check whether anyone has followed him out of the Post Office;
    a tail would also show interest in this stranger (who might be X's contact)
    and a member of the surveillance team might follow this stranger';</li>
  <li>X continues down the street, turns sharply at the corner and abruptly
    stops at a cigarette kiosk; anyone following will most likely come quickly
    around the corner and could become startled on finding X right in his path.</li>
  <li>-12. X crosses the street and joins the queue at a bus stop (11) noticing
    those joining the queue after him; a bit of acting here gives the impression
    that X is unsure of the bus he wants to catch; he could allow a couple of
    buses to go by noticing anyone who is doing the same; as a bus arrives at
    the stop across the road (12), X suddenly appears to realise it is his and
    dashes across the road to catch it as it pulls away; X is alert to anyone
    jumping on the bus after him and will also pay attention to whoever gets on
    at the next few stops.</li>
</ol>
<p>Such a series of checks must be carried out immediately prior to any
sensitive appointment or secret meeting. If nothing suspicious has occurred
during the Check Route X proceeds to his secret appointment or mission. If, on
the other hand, X has encountered certain persons over and over again on the
Check Route he will assume he is under surveillance and break his appointment.
Bear in mind that anyone following you, even professionals, may become
indecisive or startled should your paths unexpectedly cross. A Check Route
should also be carried out from time to time to check whether a person is
`clean' or not.</p>
<p><strong>8.CHECK ROUTE WITH ASSISTANCE AND BY VEHICLE</strong></p>
<p>Check Route is a planned journey, the object of which is to check whether you
are being followed. The previous example was a check route on foot, by a person
acting alone.</p>
<p>With assistance from comrades the exercise becomes more effective. The
exercise follows similar lines as previously outlined except that a comrade is
stationed at each check point and observes whether anyone is following you as
you pass by. It is essential that your behaviour appears normal and does not
look as though `checking' is taking place.</p>
<p>(Diagram 5)</p>
<p>Let us suppose that you are X. Comrades Y and Z position themselves at check
points Y1 and Z1 respectively. These observation points must give a good view of
your movements, but keep the comrades hidden from enemy agents who might be
tailing you. After X passes each check point the comrades move to new positions,
in this case Y2 and Z2. They may in fact cover four to five positions each and
the whole operation should take one to two hours over an area of three or four
kilometres. Comrades must take up each position in good time.</p>
<p>Such check points could be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>From inside a coffee shop Y gets a good view of X entering the bank
    opposite</li>
  <li><b>Z1</b> Z is in a building (roof garden, balcony or upper floor window)
    watching X's progress down the street and into the bookshop</li>
  <li><b>Y2</b> Y has moved into park and observes X's wanderings from park
    bench among the trees</li>
  <li><b>Z2</b> Z has time to occupy parked cars in car park with good view of
    all movement. After the exercise Y and Z meet to compare notes. What
    suspicious individuals have they observed? Were such people noticed in X's
    vicinity on more than just one or two occasions? Was their behaviour strange
    and were they showing unusual interest in X2 going into check what he was up
    to? Was a vehicle following them in support and were persons from the
    vehicle taking it in turns to follow X? Such persons are more easily noticed
    and remembered in quiet rather than busy areas!</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember: In order to carry out secret work you must know whether you are
under surveillance or are clean!</p>
<p><strong>9.CHECKING BY CAR</strong></p>
<p>There are many ways of countering enemy surveillance when using a vehicle. Be
extra observant when approaching your parked car and when driving off. This is
the most likely point at which tailing may start from your home, work, friends,
meeting place. Be on the lookout for strange cars, with at least two passengers
(usually males). When driving off be on the lookout for cars pulling off after
you or possibly following you from around the corner. Bear in mind that the
enemy may have two or three vehicles in the vicinity, linked by radio. They will
try to follow you in an interchanging sequence (the so-called A,B,C technique).
Cars A, B and C will constantly exchange positions so as to confuse you.</p>
<p><strong>Ruses:</strong></p>
<p>After driving off it is a useful procedure to make a U-turn and drive away in
the opposite direction, forcing any surveillance car into a hurried move. As you
proceed, notice vehicles behind you your rear-view mirror is your best friend!</p>
<p>Also pay attention to vehicles travelling ahead which may deliberately allow
you to overtake them. Cars waiting ahead of you at junctions, stop street and by
the roadside must be noted too. You will often find vehicles travelling behind
you for quite a distance, particularly on a main road or link road. Avoid
becoming nervous and over-reacting. Do not suddenly speed ahead in the hope of
losing them.</p>
<p>Remember that the point of counter-surveillance is to determine whether you
are being followed or not. Rather travel at normal speed and then slightly
reduce speed, giving normal traffic the chance of overtaking you. If the
following vehicle also reduces speed, then begin to accelerate slightly. Is that
vehicle copying you? If so, turn off the main road and see if it follows. A
further turn or two in a quiet suburb or rural area will establish whether you
have a tail.</p>
<p>There are many other ruses to determine this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Drive completely around a traffic circle as though you have missed your
    turn-off;</li>
  <li>Turn into a dead-end street as if by mistake;</li>
  <li>Turn into the driveway of a house or building and out again as if in
    error;</li>
  <li>Abruptly switch traffic lanes and unexpectedly turn left or right without
    indicating, but be sure there is no traffic cop about!</li>
  <li>Cross at a traffic light just as it turns red, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Such ruses will force a tail into unusual actions to keep up with you but
your actions must appear normal.</p>
<p><strong>Check Route</strong></p>
<p>The Check Route we previously described for checking surveillance by foot can
obviously be applied to vehicles. Your check route must be well prepared and
should include busy and quiet areas. Also include stops at places such as
garages and shops where you can carry out some counter-surveillance on foot. You
can carry out your routine by yourself or with assistance. In this case comrades
are posted at check points along your route and observe whether you are being
tailed. It is a good idea to fit your car with side-view mirrors for better
observation, including one for your passenger. At all costs avoid looking over
your shoulder (a highly suspicious action!)</p>
<p><strong></strong><strong>Enemy Tracking Device</strong></p>
<p>You should often check underneath your car in case the enemy has placed a
tracking device ('bumper bleeper') there. It is a small, battery-operated,
magnetically attached gadget that emits a direction signal to a tailing vehicle.
This enables the vehicle to remain out of your sight. When you stop for some
minutes, however, your trackers will be curious about what you are up to. This
will force them to look for you. So your check routine should involve stopping
in a quiet or remote area. Get out of your car and into a hidden position from
where you can observe any follow-up movement. If you have assistance stop your
car at a pre-arranged spot. Your comrades should drive past and check whether a
tail vehicle has halted just out of sight down the road.</p>
<p><strong>10.CUTTING THE TAIL</strong></p>
<p>The procedure of eluding those who are following you is called `cutting the
tail'. In order to do this effectively you must study the location or areas
where this can be done in advance. When you find yourself in a situation where
you need to break surveillance, you deliberately lead those who are following
you to a favourable spot where `cutting the tail' can be achieved.</p>
<p><strong>1.Change of Clothing:</strong></p>
<p>You urgently need to visit an underground contact. For several days your
attempts have been frustrated because you have come to realise that you are
being closely watched and followed by the police and their agents. You leave
work as usual but carry a shopping bag with a change of clothes. After casually
wandering around town you enter a cloakroom or such place where you can quickly
change clothing without being seen. It should be a place where other people are
constantly entering and leaving. You leave within minutes, casually dressed in a
T-shirt and sports cap. Your shirt, jacket and tie are in your shopping bag. A
bus area makes it easier to slip away unnoticed. A reversible jacket, pair of
glasses and cap kept in a pocket are useful aids for a quick change on the move.
Women in particular can make a swift change of clothing with ease, slipping on a
wig and coat or even a man's hat and jacket over a pair of jeans to confuse the
tail!</p>
<p><strong>2.Jumping on and off a Bus:</strong></p>
<p>You are being tailed but must get to a secret meeting at all costs. You could
spend some time loitering around a busy shopping area giving the impression that
you are in no hurry to get anywhere. Just as you notice a bus pulling away from
a bus stop you run after it and jump aboard. Keeping a good lookout for your
pursuers, you could jump off as it slows down at the next stop and disappear
around a busy corner.</p>
<p><strong>3.Crossing a Busy Street:</strong></p>
<p>You need to be quick and alert for this one! You deliberately lead those
following you down a busy street with heavy traffic. When you notice a momentary
break in the traffic, you could suddenly sprint across the road as though your
life depended on it. By the time the tail has managed to find a break in the
traffic and cross after you, you could have disappeared in any number of
directions!</p>
<p><strong>4.Take the Last Taxi in the Rank:</strong></p>
<p>Occupy your time in a leisurely way near a taxi rank. You could be window
shopping or drinking tea at a cafe. When you notice that there is only one taxi
left at the rank, drop everything and sprint over to it. By the time those
following you have summoned up their support cars you could have ordered the
taxi to stop and slipped away.</p>
<p><strong>5.Entering and Exiting a Building:</strong></p>
<p>A large, busy department store with many entrances, stairways, lifts and
floors is ideal for this one. After entering the building quickly slip out by
another exit. Busy hotels, restaurants, recreation centres, railway stations,
arcades, shopping centres etc. are all useful locations for this trick.</p>
<p><strong>6.Ruses when Driving:</strong></p>
<p>It is more difficult to cut a tail when driving than when on foot because a
number of vehicles may be following you in parallel streets. Fast and aggressive
driving is necessary. Sudden changes of speed and direction, crossing at a
traffic light just as it turns red, and a thorough knowledge of lanes, garages
and places where a car may be quickly concealed are possible ways in which you
may elude the tail.</p>
<p><strong>7.Get Lost in a Crowd:</strong></p>
<p>It is particularly difficult for the tail to keep up with you in crowded
areas. Know the locality, be prepared, be quick-footed and quick-witted! Be
ready to take advantage of large concentrations of people. Workers leaving a
factory, spectators at a sports fixture, crowds at a market, cinema, railway
station or rally offer all the opportunities you need.</p>
<p>Mix this with the above tactics and you will give those trying to tail you
the headache and disappointment they so richly deserve.</p>
<p><strong></strong><strong>11. SECRET COMMUNICATIONS</strong></p>
<p>Communications is vital to any form of human activity. When people become
involved in secret work they must master secret forms of communication in order
to survive detection and succeed in their aims. Without effective secret
communication no underground revolutionary movement can function. In fact
effective communication is a pillar of underground work. Yet communication
between underground activists is their most vulnerable point.</p>
<p>The enemy, his police, informers and agents are intently watching known and
suspect activists. They are looking for the links and contact points between
such activists which will give them away. It is often at the point when such
activists attempt to contact or communicate with one another that they are
observed and their would-be secrets are uncovered. The enemy watches, sees who
contacts whom, the pounces, rounding up a whole network of activists and their
supporters. But there are many methods and techniques or secret work, simple but
special forms of communication, available to revolutionaries to overcome this
key problem.</p>
<p>This section discusses these, in order to improve and perfect secret forms of
communication. These are used worldwide, including by state security organs, so
we are giving nothing away to the enemy. Rather we are attempting to arm our
people. These methods are designed to outwit the enemy and to assure continuity
of work. The qualities required are reliability, discipline, punctuality,
continuity and vigilance - which spells out efficiency in communication.</p>
<p>Before proceeding, however, let us illustrate what we are talking about with
an example: C - a member of an underground unit - is meant to meet A and B at a
secret venue. C is late and the two others have left. C rushes around town
trying to find them at their homes, work place, favourite haunts. C tries
phoning them and leaves messages. C is particularly anxious because he has
urgent information for them. People start wondering why C is in such a panic and
why he is so desperate to contact A and B who are two individuals whom they had
never before associated with C. When C finally contacts A and B they are angry
with him for two reasons. Firstly, that he came late for the appointment.
Secondly, that he violated the rules of secrecy by openly trying to contact
them. C offers an acceptable reason for his late-coming (he could prove that his
car broke down) and argues that he had urgent information for them. He states
that they had failed to make alternative arrangement for a situation such as one
of them missing a meeting. Hence, he argues, he had no alternative but to search
for them.</p>
<p>The above example is familiar to most activists. It creates two problems for
the conduct of secret work. It creates the obvious security danger as well as
leading to a breakdown in the continuity of work.</p>
<p>What methods are open to such a unit, or between activists?</p>
<p>To answer this we will be studying two main areas of communication. There are
personal and non-personal forms of communication. Personal are when two or more
persons meet under special conditions of secrecy. There are various forms of
personal meetings, such as regular, reserve, emergency, blind, check and
accidental. Then there are various non-personal forms of communication designed
to reduce the frequency of personal meetings. Amongst these are such methods as
using newspaper columns, public phone boxes, the postal system, radios and the
method made famous in spy novels and films, the so-called dead-letter-box or DLB,
where messages are passed through secret hiding places. Coding, invisible ink
and special terms are used to conceal the true or hidden meaning in messages or
conversations.</p>
<p>From this we can immediately see a solution to C's failed meeting with A and
B. All they needed to arrange was a reserve meeting place in the event of one or
more of them failing to turn up at the initial venue. This is usually at a
different time and place to the earlier meeting. The other forms of meetings
cover all possibilities.</p>
<p><strong>12. PERSONAL MEETINGS</strong></p>
<p>In the previous section we began to discuss the methods members of an
underground unit should use when communicating with one another. The most
important requirement that must be solved is how to meet secretly and reliably.</p>
<p>Let us suppose that comrade A has the task of organising an underground unit
with B and C. In the interests of secrecy they must, as far as possible, avoid
visiting one another at home or at wok. (Such links must be kept to a minimum or
even totally avoided so that other people do not have the impression that they
are closely connected.)</p>
<p>First of all they need to have a regular or main meeting - let's say every
two weeks. For this meeting A lays down three conditions. These are: place, time
and legend.</p>
<p><strong>Place of Meeting:</strong></p>
<p>This must be easy to find, approach and leave. It must be a safe place to
meet, allowing privacy and a feeling of security. It could be a friend's flat,
office, picnic place, beauty spot, beach, park, vehicle, quiet cafe, etc. The
possibilities are endless. It is essential that the meeting place be changed
from time to time. Sometimes, instead of indicating the meeting place, A might
instruct B and C to meet him at different contact points on the route to the
meeting such as outside a cinema, bus stop etc. This can provide a greater
degree of security. But it is best to begin with the most simple arrangements.</p>
<p><strong>Time:</strong></p>
<p>Date and time of the meeting must be clearly memorised. Punctuality is
essential. If anyone fails to arrive at the meeting place within the prearranged
time the meeting must be cancelled. As a rule the time for waiting must never
exceed ten minutes. Under no circumstances must a comrade proceed to the meeting
if he or she finds themselves under surveillance.</p>
<p><strong>Legend:</strong></p>
<p>This is an invented but convincing explanation (cover story) as to why A, B
and C are always together at the same place at the same time. The legend will
depend on the type of people who are meeting. Suppose A and B are black men and
C is an older, white woman. Since it would look unusual and attract attention if
they met at a park or picnic place, A has decided on an office which C has
loaned from a reliable friend. They meet at 5.30pm when the office is empty. C
has told her friend that she requires the premises in order to interview some
people for a job or some story to that effect. On the desk she will have
interview notes and other documents to support her story and B and C will carry
job applications or references. If anyone interrupts the meeting or if they are
questioned later, they will have a convincing explanation for their meeting.</p>
<p><strong>Order of the Meeting:</strong></p>
<p>At the start of the meeting A checks on the well-being and security of each
comrade, particularly whether everything was in order on their route to the
meeting. Did they check for possible surveillance? Next A will inform them of
the legend for the meeting. Then, before business is discussed, A will pass
around a piece of paper with the time and place of the next meeting written on
it. Nothing is spoken in case the meeting is `bugged'. This matter is settled in
case they are interrupted and have to leave the meeting in a hurry. In such an
event they already know the conditions for the next meeting and continuity of
contact is assured.</p>
<p><strong>Reserve Meeting:</strong></p>
<p>In arranging the regular meeting of the unit, A takes into account the
possibility of one or more of them failing to get to that meeting. He therefore
explains the conditions for a reserve meeting. These also include place, time
and legend. Whilst the time for a reserve meeting may be the same as a regular
meeting (but obviously on a different day), the place must always differ. A
instructs them that if a regular meeting fails to take place they must
automatically meet two days later at such-and-such a time and place. The
conditions for a reserve meeting might be kept constant, not changing as often
as those of the regular meeting, because the need for such a meeting may not
often arise. But A takes care to remind the comrades of these conditions at
every regular meeting.</p>
<p>Having arranged conditions for both regular and reserve meetings, A feels
confident that he has organised reliability and continuity of such contact. It
is necessary for all to observe the rules of secrecy, and to be punctual,
reliable, disciplined and vigilant about such meetings.</p>
<p>But what if comrade A needs to see B and C suddenly and urgently and cannot
wait for the regular meeting?</p>
<p><strong>13. EMERGENCY AND CHECK MEETINGS</strong></p>
<p>The leader of an underground unit, comrade A, has arranged regular and
reserve meetings with B and C. This allows for reliability and continuity of
contact in the course of their secret work. This has been progressing well.
Comrade A decides to organise other forms of meetings with them because of the
complexity of work.</p>
<p><strong>1. Emergency Meeting:</strong></p>
<p>The comrades have found that they sometimes need to meet urgently between
their regular meetings. An emergency meeting is for the rapid establishment of
contact should the comrades need to see each other between the set meetings.</p>
<p>There are similar conditions as for a regular meeting such as: Time, Place
and Legend. The additional element is a signal for calling the meeting. This
signal might be used by either the unit leader A or the other cell members, when
they need to convey urgent information. A confirmation signal is also necessary
which indicates that the call signal has been seen or understood. This must
never be placed at the same location as the call signal.</p>
<p><strong>Signals:</strong></p>
<p>These are prearranged signs, phrases, words, marks or objects put in
specified places such as on objects in the streets, on buildings etc., or
specified phrases in postcards, letters, on the telephone etc.</p>
<p><strong>Example of Emergency Meeting:</strong></p>
<p>Comrade A has directed that the venue for the unit's Emergency meeting is a
certain park bench beside a lake. The time is for 5.30pm on the same day that
the call signal is used. As with Regular meetings he also indicates a Reserve
venue for the Emergency meeting. Comrade A arranges different call signals for B
and C, which they can also use if they need to summon him.</p>
<p><strong>Call and Answer Signal for B:</strong></p>
<p>This signal could be a `chalk mark' placed by A on a certain lamp-post.
Comrade A knows that B walks passed the pole every morning at a certain time on
his way to work. B must always be on the look-out for the chalk mark. This could
simply be the letter `X' in red chalk. By 2pm. that day B must have responded
with the confirmation signal. This could be a piece of coloured string wound
round a fence near a bus stop. It could equally be a piece of blue chalk crushed
into the pavement by the steps of a building or some graffiti scrawled on a
poster (in other words anything clear, visible and innocent-looking). The two
comrades can now expect to meet each other at the park bench later that day.</p>
<p><strong>Call and Answer Signal for C:</strong></p>
<p>C has a telephone at home. Before she leaves for work, comrade A phones her
from a public call-box. He pretends to dial a wrong number. `Good morning, is
that Express Dairy?' he asks. `Sorry, wrong number', C replies and adds: `Not
such a good morning, you got me out of the bath'. This is C's innocent way of
confirming that she has understood the signal. Obviously such a signal cannot be
repeated.</p>
<p><strong>2. Check Meeting</strong></p>
<p>This is a `meeting' between the unit leader and a subordinate comrade to
establish only through visual contact whether the comrade is all right. Such a
check-up becomes necessary when a comrade has been in some form of danger and
where direct physical contact is unsafe to attempt, such as if the comrade has
been questioned by the police or been under surveillance.</p>
<p>There are a number of conditions for such a meeting: Date and Time; Place or
Route of movement; Actions; Legend; Signals - indicating danger or well-being.</p>
<p><strong>Example of Check Meeting:</strong></p>
<p>C has been questioned by the police. As a result contact with her has been
cut. After a few days comrade A wants to check how she is and calls her through
a signal to a Check meeting.</p>
<p>At 4pm. on the day following the call signal C goes shopping. She wears a
yellow scarf indicating that she was subject to mild questioning and that
everything has appeared normal since. She follows a route which takes her past
the Post Office by 4.20pm. She does not know where A is but he has taken up a
position which conceals his presence and gives him a good view of C. He is also
able to observe whether C is being followed. On passing the Post Office C stops
to blow her nose. This is to reinforce her feeling that everything is now
normal. It is for A to decide whether to restore contact with C or to leave her
on `ice' for a while longer, subjecting her to further checks.</p>
<p><strong>14. BLIND MEETING</strong></p>
<p>The leader of an underground unit, comrade A, receives instructions from the
leadership to meet comrade D. Comrade D is a new recruit, whom the leadership
are assigning to A's unit. A and D are strangers to one another. Conditions are
therefore drawn up for a Blind Meeting - that is a meeting between two
underground workers who are unknown to one another.</p>
<p><strong>Recognition signs and passwords</strong></p>
<p>There are similar conditions as for regular and other forms of meeting, such
as date, time, place, action of subordinate and legend. In addition, there is
the necessity for recognition signs and passwords, which are to aid in
identification.</p>
<p>The recognition signs enable the commander or senior, in this case A, to
identify the subordinate from a safe distance and at close quarters. Two
recognition signs are therefore needed.</p>
<p>The passwords, including the reply, are specially prepared words and phrases
which are exchanged and give the go-ahead for the contact to begin. These signs
and phrases must look normal and not attract attention to outsiders.</p>
<p>At this point the reader should prepare an example for a blind meeting and
compare it with the example we have given. Our example has been purposely
printed upside down to encourage the reader to participate in this suggested
exercise. Do remember that all the examples given in our series are also read by
the enemy, so do not blindly copy them. They are suggestions to assist activists
with their own ideas.</p>
<p><strong>Example of Blind Meeting Place: Toyshop on Smith Street.</strong></p>
<p><b>Date and Time:</b> December 20th, 6pm.</p>
<p><b>Action:</b> Comrade D to walk down street in easterly direction, to stop
at Toyshop and gaze at toy display for five minutes.</p>
<p><b>Legend:</b> D is simply walking about town carrying out window shopping.
When A makes contact they are to behave as though they are strangers who have
just struck up a friendship.</p>
<p><b>Recognition signs:</b> D carries an OK Bazaars shopping bag. The words
`OK' have been underlined with a black pen (for close-up recognition).</p>
<p><b>Passwords:</b></p>
<p>A: Pardon me, but do you know whether this shop sells children's books? B: I
don't know. There are only toys in the window.</p>
<p>A: I prefer to give books for presents.</p>
<p>Note: The opening phrase will be used by A after he has observed D's
movements and satisfied himself that the recognition signs are correct and that
D has not been followed. A completes the passwords with a closing phrase which
satisfies D that A is the correct contact. The two can now walk off together or
A might suggest a further meeting somewhere else.</p>
<p><strong>Brush Meeting</strong></p>
<p>This is a brief meeting where material is quickly and silently passed from
one comrade to another. Conditions for such a meeting, such as place, time and
action, are carefully planned beforehand. No conversation takes place. Money,
reports or instructions are swiftly transferred. Split-second timing is
necessary and contact must take place in a dead zone i.e. in areas where passing
the material cannot be seen.</p>
<p>For example, as D walks down the steps of a department store A passes D and
drops a small package into D's shopping bag.</p>
<p><strong>'Accidental' Meeting</strong></p>
<p>This is, in fact, a deliberate contact made by the commander which comes as a
surprise to the subordinate. In other words, it takes place without the
subordinate's foreknowledge.</p>
<p>An `accidental' meeting takes place where:</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>there has been a breakdown in communication.</li>
  <li>the subordinate is not fully trusted and the commander wants to have an
    `unexpected' talk with him or her.</li>
</ol>
<p>The commander must have good knowledge of the subordinate's movements and
plan his or her actions before, during and after the meeting.</p>
<p><strong>15. NON-PERSONAL COMMUNICATION</strong></p>
<p>Comrade A has been mainly relying on personal forms of communication to run
the underground unit. With the police stepping up their search for revolutionary
activists he decides to increase the use of non-personal communication.</p>
<p>These are forms of secret communication carried out without direct contact.
These do not replace the essential meetings of the unit, but reduce the number
of times the comrades need to meet, thereby minimising the risks.</p>
<p><strong>The Main Forms:</strong></p>
<p>These are telephone, postal system, press, signals, radio and dead letter box
(DLB). The first three are in everyday use and can be used for secret work if
correctly exploited. Signals can be used as part of the other forms or as a
system on their own. Radio communication (coded) will be used by higher organs
of the Movement and not by a unit like A's. The DLB is the most effective way of
passing on material and information without personal contact.</p>
<p>Comrade A introduces these methods cautiously because misunderstandings are
possible. People prefer face-to-face contact so confidence and skill must be
developed.</p>
<p><strong>Telephone, Post and Press:</strong></p>
<p>These are reliable means of secret communication if used properly. Used
carelessly in the past they have been the source of countless arrests. The enemy
intercepts telephone calls and mail going to known activists and those they
regard as suspicious. Phone calls can be traced and telexes as well as letters
intercepted. International communication is especially vulnerable. For example,
a phone call from Botswana to Soweto is likely to arouse the enemy's interest.
What is required are safe phones and addresses through which can be passed
innocent-sounding messages for calling meetings, re-establishing contact,
warning of danger, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Telephone:</strong> This allows for the urgent transmission of a
signal or message. The telephone must be used with a reliable and convincing
coding system and legend. Under no circumstances must the phone be used for
involved discussion on sensitive topics.</p>
<p>Comrade A has already used the phone to call C to an emergency meeting (See
No 14 of this series). The arrangement was that he pretended to dial a wrong
number. This was the signal to meet at a pre-arranged place and time.</p>
<p>Up to now he has been meeting with her to collect propaganda material. He now
wishes to signal her when to pick it up herself, but prefers to avoid phoning
her at home or work. If she takes lunch regularly at a certain cafe or is at a
sports club at a certain time or near a public phone, he knows how to reach her
when he wishes.</p>
<p>A simple call such as the following is required: `Is that Miss So-and-So?
This is Ndlovu here. I believe you want to buy my Ford Escort? If so, you can
view it tomorrow.' This could mean that C must collect the propaganda material
at a certain place in two days time. The reference to a car is a code for
picking up propaganda material; Ndlovu is the code name for the pick-up place;
tomorrow means two days time (two days time would mean three days).</p>
<p><strong>Post:</strong></p>
<p>This can be used to transmit similar messages as above. A telegram or
greeting card with the message that `Uncle Morris is having an operation' could
be a warning from A to C to cut contact and lie low until further notice because
of possible danger. The use of a particular kind of picture postcard could be a
signal for a meeting at a pre-arranged place ten days after the date on the
card. Signals can be contained in the form the sender writes the address, the
date or the greeting. `My dear friend' together with the fictitious address of
the sender - `No 168 Fox Street' - means to be ready for a leaflet distribution
and meet at 16 hours on the 8th of the month at a venue code-named `Fox'.</p>
<p>Many such forms of signals can be used in letters. Even the way the postage
stamp is placed can be of significance.</p>
<p><strong>Press:</strong></p>
<p>This is the use of the classified ads section: `Candy I miss you. Please
remember our Anniversary of the 22nd, love Alan'. This could be A's arrangement
for re-establishing contact with C if she has gone into hiding. The venue and
time will have been pre-arranged, but the advert will signal the day. Such ads
give many possibilities not only in the press but on notice boards in colleges,
hostels, shopping centres, and so on.</p>
<p><strong>16. SIGNALS</strong></p>
<p>Comrade A has been introducing various forms of Non-Personal Communications (NPC)
to his underground unit. At times he has carefully used the telephone, post and
press to pass on innocent-sounding messages, (see No.16 of this series). Key
phrases, spoken and written, have acted as signals for calling meetings, warning
of danger etc. He has also used graphic signals, such as a chalk mark on a lamp
post, or an object like a coloured piece of string tied to a fence, as call and
answer signs (see No.14).</p>
<p>Signals can be used for a variety of reasons and are essential in secret
work. They greatly improve the level of security of the underground and help to
avoid detection by the enemy forces.</p>
<p><strong>Everyday Signals</strong></p>
<p>The everyday use of signals shows how useful they are in conveying messages,
and what an endless variety exists. Road traffic is impossible without traffic
lights (where colour carries the message) and road signs (where symbols or
graphics are used). Consider how hand signals are used in different ways not
only to direct traffic but for countless purposes from sport to soldiers on
patrol. Everybody uses the thumbs-up signal to show that all is well. Consider
how police and robbers use signals and you will realise how important they are
for underground work. In fact in introducing this topic to his unit Comrade A
asks them to give examples of everyday signals. The reader should test his or
her imagination in this respect.</p>
<p>For our purpose signals are divided into TYPE and USAGE.</p>
<p><strong>* Type:</strong></p>
<p><b>Sound</b> - voice, music, whistle, animal sound, knocking etc. Colour -
all the hues of the rainbow!</p>
<p><b>Graphic</b> - drawing, figures, letters, numbers, marks, graffiti, symbols
etc. Actions - behaviour/movement of a person or vehicle.</p>
<p><b>Objects</b> - the placing or movement of anything from sticks and stones
to flower pots and flags.</p>
<p><strong>* Use:</strong></p>
<p>To call all forms of meetings; to instruct people to report to a certain
venue or individual; to instruct people to prepare for a certain task or action;
to inform of danger or well-being; to indicate that a task has been carried out;
to indicate a presence or absence of surveillance; to indicate recognition
between people.</p>
<p>Whatever signals are invented to cover the needs of the unit they must be
simple, easy to understand and not attract attention.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of how signals can be used: One example is included
which is bad from the security point of view. See if you can spot it. Consider
each example in terms of type and usage:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Comrade A draws a red arrow on a wall to call B to an emergency meeting.</li>
  <li>D whistles a warning to C, who is slipping a leaflet under a door,
    indicating that someone is approaching.</li>
  <li>B stops at a postbox and blows his nose, indicating to A, observing from a
    safe distance, that he is being followed.</li>
  <li>D hangs only blue washing on his clothes line to indicate that the police
    have visited him and that he believes he is in danger.</li>
  <li>B enters a hotel wearing a suit with a pink carnation and orders a bottle
    of champagne. These are signals to C that she should join him for a secret
    discussion.</li>
  <li>C, having to deliver weapons to `Esther', whom she has not met before,
    must park her car at a rest-spot venue on the highway. C places a tissue-box
    on the dash-board and drinks a can of cola. These are the recognition
    signals for E to approach her and ask the way to the nearest petrol station.
    This phrase and a Mickey-Mouse key-ring held by E are the signs which show C
    that E is her blind contact. (Note: both will use false number plates on
    their cars to remain anonymous from each other).</li>
  <li>C places a strip of coloured sticky tape inside a public telephone box to
    inform A that she has successfully delivered weapons to E.</li>
</ul>
<p>The bad example? D's pink carnation and champagne draws unwanted attention.</p>
<p><strong></strong><strong>17. DEAD LETTER BOX</strong></p>
<p>Comrade A's underground unit has been mastering forms of Non-Personal
Communication to make their work secret and efficient. Comrade A feels they now
have sufficient experience to use the DLB, sometimes called a `dead drop', to
pass literature, reports and funds between one another.</p>
<p><strong>The DLB</strong></p>
<p>It is a hiding place such as a hollow in a tree or the place under the
floorboards. It is used like a `post box' to pass material between two people.</p>
<p>To give a definition: A DLB is a natural or man-made hiding place for the
storage and transfer of material.</p>
<p>It can be a large space for hiding weapons or small for messages. It can be
located inside buildings or out of doors; in town or countryside. It can be in
natural spaces such as the tree or floorboards, or manufactured by the
operative, such as a hollowed out fence pole or a hole in the ground. It is
always camouflaged.</p>
<p><strong>Selecting the DLB</strong></p>
<p>It is very important to carefully select the place where the DLB is to be
located. Follow the rules:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It must be easy to describe and find. Avoid complicated or confusing
    descriptions which make it difficult for your partner to find it.</li>
  <li>It must be safe and secure. It must be well concealed from casual
    onlookers. Beware of places where children play, gardeners work or tramps
    hang-out. It must not be near enemy bases or places where guards are on
    duty. It must not be overlooked by buildings and windows.</li>
  <li>It must allow for safe deposit and removal of material. The operatives
    must feel secure about their actions in depositing and removing material.
    They must be able to check whether they are being watched. The place must be
    in keeping with their public image and legend.</li>
  <li>It must allow for weather conditions and time of day. DLBs can be exposed
    or damaged by rain or flooding. Some locations may be suspicious to approach
    by day and dangerous by night.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong></strong><strong>Preparation</strong></p>
<p>This involves constructing and camouflaging the DLB; making a diagram;
working out a signal system and security arrangements. If you are burying the
material put it in a tin, bottle or weather-proof container.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Once you have selected the place for your DLB you will have to prepare it.
    This will usually take place under cover of night whether you are digging a
    hole or hollowing out a cavity in a tree and camouflaging it.</li>
  <li>You will have to make an accurate description, preferably including a
    simple diagram.</li>
  <li>You will have to work out a signal system for yourself and partner
    indicating deposit and removal of material.</li>
  <li>Finally, work out a check route to and from the DLB and a legend for being
    there.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong></strong><strong>Example of DLB</strong></p>
<p>Comrade A has spotted a loose brick in a wall. The wall is located along a
little used path and shielded by trees. At night he hollows-out a space behind
the brick, large enough to take a small package. The loose brick is the tenth
along the wall, second row down. The brick fits securely into the wall but can
be quickly removed with the use of a nail. The operation takes ten seconds and
the footsteps of any stranger approaching can be easily heard.</p>
<p><strong>A's Description of the DLB</strong></p>
<p>Reference No. DLB 3. `Loose Brick in wall'</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> Path leading from Fourth Street to Golf Course</p>
<p><strong></strong><strong>Direction:</strong> In Fourth Street, just past the
61 Bus Stop, is the path, with red brick wall on the right, wooden fence on the
left. Three paces down the path, on the right, just before a tree, is the DLB,
in the brick wall.</p>
<p><strong>The DLB:</strong></p>
<p>It is a loose brick, with white paint smudge. As you walk down the path from
Fourth Street, it is the tenth brick along the wall, second row from top. In the
space between this brick and the ninth brick is a hole. Place a nail into this
hole to help prise out the brick. The space behind the brick holds a package
wrapped in plastic with dimensions: 12x6x3 cm. After removing the package
replace brick using blue tack (or other sealing substance) to hold it in place.</p>
<p><strong>Signals:</strong> 1. After A deposits material he ties a piece of red
string to a fence signalling that the DLB is `loaded'. 2. After B removes
material from the DLB he draws a chalk mark signal on a pole.</p>
<p>Note: Signals must not be in the DLB's vicinity.</p>
<p>Diagram</p>
<p><strong>Carrying Out the Operation</strong></p>
<p>The use of the DLB is an operation which must be carefully planned as
follows:</p>
<p><strong>Comrade A:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Prepares material (packaging and camouflaging)</li>
  <li>Checks route for surveillance</li>
  <li>Observes situation at DLB</li>
  <li>Places material (if no surveillance)</li>
  <li>Return route to check for surveillance</li>
  <li>Places signal indicating deposit</li>
  <li>Returns home</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Comrade B:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Sees signal of deposit</li>
  <li>Checks route</li>
  <li>Observes situation at DLB</li>
  <li>Removes material (if no surveillance)</li>
  <li>Return route to check for surveillance)</li>
  <li>Places signal of removal</li>
  <li>Returns home.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Comrade A:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Checks signal of removal</li>
  <li>Removes signals</li>
  <li>Reports success</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: It is important that both A and B check that they are not being
followed when they go to the DLB and after leaving it.</p>
<p><strong>18. STATIONARY, PORTABLE AND MOBILE DLBs</strong></p>
<p>We have been discussing the use of the dead letter box (DLB) through which
underground members secretly pass material to each other. There are various
types of DLBs:</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Stationary DLBs</b> are fixed places such as a camouflaged hole in the
    ground, hollow tree trunk or fence pole, loose brick in a wall (as described
    in last issue).</li>
  <li><b>Portable DLBs</b> are containers which can be carried and left in
    innocent places to be picked up, e.g. discarded cigarette pack, hollowed-out
    stick or fake piece of rock.</li>
  <li><b>Mobile DLBs</b> are in different types of transport (car, bus, train,
    boat or plane) and are used to communicate between operatives who live far
    apart.</li>
  <li><b>Magnetic DLBs:</b> A simple magnet attached to a container increases
    opportunities for finding places to leave your DLB. With the aid of magnets
    you are able to clamp your DLB to any metal object such as behind a drain
    pipe, under the rail of a bridge, under a vehicle, etc.
    <p>Comrade `A' will use a variety of DLBs with `B'. Never use a stationary
    DLB too often because this increases the risk of being spotted. The
    advantage of a portable DLB is that the place where it is left can be
    constantly changed. Because of the danger of a stranger picking it up by
    chance the time between making the drop and the pick-up by your partner must
    not be long.</li>
  <li><b>Portable DLB</b> - `Wooden Stick':
    <p>Buy a piece of plastic tubing or pipe. Cut off a 30cm length. Glue pieces
    of bark around it to make it look like a twig. With a little patience you
    will be surprised at how realistic you can make it. You have a portable DLB
    into which you can insert material. Work out a suitable location where it
    can be safely dropped for a pick-up. You can carry it up your sleeve and
    drop it in long grass or into a bush near an easy-to-locate reference point.
    It must be concealed from passers-by and nosey dogs!</p>
    <p>Alternatively you can try hollowing out an actual piece of branch, or
    splitting it down the side and gluing it. But you will probably find the
    plastic pipe easier to handle and longer-lasting.</li>
  <li><b>Portable DLB </b>- `Hollow Rock': Experiment with plaster of paris
    (which you can buy from a chemist) and mould it into the shape of a rock.
    Allow enough of a hollow to hide material. With paint and mud you can make
    it look like a realistic rock. Carry it to the drop-off point in a shopping
    bag.
    <p>(<i>Note: the above can serve as a portable DLB as well as a useful
    hiding place for the storage of sensitive material around the home</i>).</li>
  <li><b>Mobile DLB:</b> Comrade `A' uses the Johannesburg to Durban train to
    send material to comrades down at the coast. There are numerous hiding
    places on trains, as with other forms of transport, and if you use magnets
    the possibilities are increased. Removing a panel in a compartment provides
    a useful hiding place. Comrade `A' does this long before the train's
    departure, before other passengers arrive. He has a telephonic signal system
    with the Durban comrades to indicate when the material is on its way and how
    to locate it. They might get on the train before it reaches Durban. Whatever
    the case, the operational system must be carefully studied at both ends.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong></strong><strong>19. FAILURE AND HOW TO DEAL WITH IT</strong></p>
<p>Our series would not be complete if we did not deal with failure in the
underground and how to react to setbacks.</p>
<p><strong>1. WHAT DO WE MEAN BY &quot;FAILURE&quot;?</strong></p>
<p>When members of the underground are exposed, arrested or killed, when the
underground structure is broken-up or destroyed by the enemy - failure has
occurred. Failure can be where PARTIAL only some members are affected or
COMPLETE, where the entire network or machinery is smashed. OPEN failures are
those that the enemy chooses to publicise. CONCEALED failures occur when the
enemy succeeds in infiltrating the underground with its agents but keeps this
secret. In this case they make no immediate arrests choosing instead to
patiently obtain information over a long period.</p>
<p><strong>2. REASONS FOR FAILURE</strong></p>
<p>There are numerous causes of arrests and setbacks.</p>
<p><strong>a) Violating the rules of secrecy:</strong></p>
<p>This is one of the main causes of failure. To carry out secret work
successfully everyone must strictly follow the organisational &amp; personal
rules of behaviour that have been outlined in this series.</p>
<p>Common violation of the rules are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>failure to limit the number of links between persons (knowledge of others
    must be limited)</li>
  <li>not keeping to the principle of vertical lines of communication (eg. a
    cell leader must not have horizontal contact with other cell leaders but
    only with a contact from the higher organ)</li>
  <li>failure to compartmentalise or isolate different organs from one another (eg.
    comrades responsible for producing propaganda must not take part in its
    distribution)</li>
  <li>poor discipline (eg: loose talk; carelessness with documents; conspicuous
    or unnatural behaviour etc.)</li>
  <li>poor recruitment practises (eg: failure to check on person's background;
    failure to test reliability; selecting one's friends without considering
    genuine qualities etc.)</li>
  <li>failure to use codes and conceal real identities</li>
  <li>weak cover stories</li>
  <li>legends</li>
  <li>poor preparation of operations &amp; meetings</li>
  <li>violating the rule of &quot;knowing only as much as you need to know&quot;</li>
  <li>not using the standard methods of personal and impersonal communications</li>
  <li>inadequate preparation of comrades for arrest and interrogation so that
    they reveal damaging information.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>b) Weak knowledge of the operational situation:</strong></p>
<p>This means not paying sufficient attention to the conditions in the area
where you carry out your tasks. Comrades are often caught because they failed to
study the methods used by the enemy, the time of police patrols, guard system,
use of informers etc. Mistakes are made if you fail to take into account the
behaviour of local people, cultural mannerisms and habits, forms of dress etc.
Knowledge of political, economic, geographic and transport conditions are part
of the operational picture.</p>
<p><strong>c) Weakly trained and poorly selected operatives:</strong></p>
<p>The underground can only be as strong as its members. Poorly trained leaders
result in weak leadership, weak communication links and poor training of
subordinates. This leads to wrong decisions and incorrect behaviour throughout
the structure and a whole series of mistakes. Care and caution are the key to
the selection of capable leaders and recruitment of operatives.</p>
<p><strong></strong><strong>d) Weak professional, political and personal
qualities:</strong></p>
<p>Serious shortcomings in the qualities required for underground work can lead
to failure. For example a comrade who is sound politically and has good
operational skills but who drinks heavily or gambles can put a machinery at
risk. Similarly a person with good professional and personal qualities but who
is politically confused can be the cause of failure. And a person with good
political understanding and fine personal qualities but who has weak operational
capability is best used for legal work.</p>
<p><strong>e) Chance or accident:</strong></p>
<p>An unlucky incident can lead to arrest but is the least likely cause of
failure.</p>
<p><strong>3. PREVENTING FAILURE</strong></p>
<p>Following the principles and rules of secrecy greatly reduces the possibility
of failure - &quot;Prevention is better than cure&quot;. But when failure occurs
we must already be armed with the plans and procedures for dealing with the
situation.</p>
<p><strong>20. DETECTING AND LOCALISING FAILURE</strong></p>
<p>When the principles and rules of secrecy are poorly applied failure and
arrests follow. The main dangers come from infiltration by enemy agents or the
arrest of comrades on operations. DETECTING failure means to be aware of the
danger in good time. LOCALISING failure means to act in order to quickly contain
the crisis and prevent the damage spreading. The following are the main points
to consider:</p>
<p><strong>1. REVIEW THE MACHINERY:</strong></p>
<p>It is only possible to detect and localise failure if the underground has
been built on a solid basis according to the correct organisational principles.
A study and review of the structure, lines of communication and the personnel is
an essential part of secret work. But it becomes impossible to obtain a clear
picture if the underground has been loosely and incorrectly put together and is
composed of some unsuitable persons. In such a situation it becomes very
difficult to correct mistakes and prevent infiltration. A network which is
tightly organised, operates according to the rules of secrecy and is cleared of
unsuitable operatives is easier to review and manage.</p>
<p><strong>2. CHECK SUSPECTS:</strong></p>
<p>This is part of the work of reviewing the machinery. It must be carried out
discretely so as not to alert the enemy or undermine the confidence of
operatives.</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>Review the suspects behaviour, movement and performance;</li>
  <li>check with co-workers, friends, family;</li>
  <li>carry out surveillance by the security organ after exhausting the other
    checks to determine whether there are links with the police.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>SOME TACTICS OF ENEMY AGENTS:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>they try to win your confidence by smooth talk and compliments;</li>
  <li>they try to arouse your interest by big talk and promises;</li>
  <li>try to get information and names from you which is no business of theirs;</li>
  <li>try to get you to rearrange lines of communication and contact points to
    help police surveillance;</li>
  <li>may show signs of nervousness, behave oddly, show excessive curiosity;</li>
  <li>may pressurise you to speed up their recruitment or someone they have
    recommended;</li>
  <li>ignore instructions, fail to observe rules of secrecy;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>good comrades can be guilty of lapses in behaviour from time to time, and
  agents can be very clever. So do not jump to conclusions but study the
  suspect's behaviour with care and patience. Sooner or later they will make a
  mistake.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>4. LOCALISING FAILURE:</strong></p>
<p>This involves two things: acting against infiltration when it is detected and
acting against exposure of the machinery and preventing further arrests, capture
of documents, material etc.</p>
<p>a) Acting against infiltration:</p>
<p>The severity of action will depend on the stage reached and the danger posed.
The enemy agent may be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>cut-off without explanation;</li>
  <li>politely cut-off with a good, believable pretext (eg. told the underground
    unit is being dissolved);</li>
  <li>&quot;frozen&quot; - told they are not being involved because they are
    being held in reserve;</li>
  <li>arrested and taken out of the country as a prisoner;</li>
  <li>eliminated - where they pose serious danger to the survival of comrades
    and there is no other way.</li>
</ul>
<p>b) Avoiding arrest:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The moment it is known that a comrade has been arrested those whose
    identities he or she could reveal must immediately go into hiding. Most
    arrests take place because this rule is ignored. Even if it is believed that
    the arrested comrade is unlikely to break this precaution must be observed.</li>
  <li>Everyone must have an &quot;ESCAPE PLAN&quot;. This includes an early
    warning system; assistance; safe hiding place; funds; transport; disguise;
    new documents of identity;</li>
  <li>Endangered comrades may &quot;lie low&quot; until the threat passes or
    work in another part of the country or leave the country;</li>
  <li>All links must be cut with a comrade who has come under enemy suspicion or
    surveillance. In this case the comrade may be &quot;put on ice&quot; until
    the danger has passed.</li>
  <li>All documents, incriminating material etc. must be destroyed or removed
    from storage places known to the arrested comrade including from his or her
    house and place of work;</li>
  <li>All comrades must be instructed on how to behave if arrested. They must
    refuse to give away their fellow comrades and strive to resist even under
    torture. The longer they resist the more time they give their comrades to
    disappear and get rid of evidence.</li>
  <li>Everything must be done to help the arrested comrade by providing legal
    representation, publicity, food and reading material if possible, solidarity
    with the family, organising protest.</li>
</ul>
